# Encoding and decoding method prospect

For now, reseachers main directions are

1. How to decrease cost of reading and writing.
2. How to utilise a mathematic scheme to decrease error.
3. How to use a way to save data as a SQL method.



1. A two-to-one correspondence where a binary zero was represented by either an adenine or cytosine and a binary one was represented by a guanine or thymine. 

2. A simple code where bits were mapped one-to-one with bases, which had the shortcoming that it led to long runs of the same base, the sequencing of which is error-prone.
3. To use of an error-correcting encoding scheme to ensure the extremely low data-loss rate, as well as the idea of encoding the data in a series of overlapping short oligonucleotides* identifiable through a sequence-based indexing scheme. Also, the sequences of the individual strands of DNA overlapped in such a way that each region of data was repeated four times to avoid errors. Two of these four strands were constructed backwards, also with the goal of eliminating errors.
4. To implement a memory efficiency version of the algorithm proposed by Goldman et al. to encode (and decode) data to DNA (.dnac files).
5. Reedâ€“Solomon error correction.
6. Church and Technicolor Research and Innovation - [An article is Forward Error Correction for DNA Data Storage](https://github.com/ZhangYizhe/DNADigitalDataStorage/blob/main/Reference/Forward%20Error%20Correction%20for%20DNA%20Data%20Storage.pdf)
